Everclimb Data
README

A tiny file for a tiny purpose: introducing new GMS homebrew content. All Everclimb content is available starting at LL0.
You can find more Lancer content at https://github.com/c0dinHB/c0din-in-public, at https://c0din.itch.io/, and at https://c0din.substack.com/.

I keep an irregularly updated file containing stuff for open playtest at https://c0din.itch.io/lancer-playtest-lab. If you try it, please let me know what you thought of it!

Everclimb Data<br>
NEW GMS MECHS: Khumbu (Support/Striker)<br>
NEW GMS EQUIPMENT: Burst-Fire Personal Defense Weapon (Weapon), Burst-Fire Pistol (Weapon), Network Shielding (Sys), Stripped Armor (Sys)

You are 100% allowed to use this stuff in your personal games.<br>
If you use it as part of something free that is released for public consumption (like a Lancer game stream, etc.) please credit the content and me, the creator.<br>
You may not use these files in anything that presents them as yours. They also may not be used in paid content.

Have fun, and light up those stars, pilots!
