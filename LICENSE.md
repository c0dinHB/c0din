For my (I'm c0din, hi) Lancer content, the following two-part license applies:

FREE CONTENT<br>
For free content, such as player-facing content, you are allowed to use it in your personal games ad libitum.
You are allowed to stream it and otherwise show it off in public so long as you properly credit the work and me as the creator.
You are not allowed to represent it as your own work.
You are allowed to amend it for personal use, but are not allowed to publish those changes (that would fall under "representing it as your own work", unfortunately).
You may not sell it. Period.
You are allowed to spread it around and post it for others to see and use, including in public, as long as I'm credited. Please direct others to my Substack, github, and/or itch page (see below).

PAID CONTENT<br>
For paid content, such as GM-facing content, you are allowed to use it in your personal games ad libitum.
You are allowed to stream it and otherwise show it off in public so long as you properly credit the work and me as the creator.
You are not allowed to represent it as your own work.

LET ME KNOW HOW IT GOES<br>
I make this stuff both for my personal game table, where I'm typically the DM/GM, and for public use.
PLEASE let me know how it goes over at your table. If you see a typo (remember that some writing is in-character), have a trip report, have question, reach out to me. The links above should have ample space to do so.
Much love, y'all. Have fun!
